# ALX AI Agent ‚Äì Code Review Agent + Simple Chatbot

This project is a small, Bun + TypeScript codebase showcasing two AI-powered capabilities:

- Code Review Agent (terminal streaming) based on a focused code review system prompt and a Git diff tool.
- Simple AI Chatbot with:
  - CLI interface (streaming to stdout)
  - Minimal Web UI served via `Bun.serve()`
  - Dashboard sidebar for quick navigation (New Chat, Recent Chats, Settings, About)

The stack uses `ai` and `@ai-sdk/google` to stream responses from a Google model.

## üîñ Project Title & Description

- **Title:** ALX AI Agent ‚Äì Code Review Agent + Simple Chatbot
- **What we‚Äôre building:** A lightweight AI toolkit with (1) a streaming code review agent that inspects recent file diffs and (2) a simple AI chatbot available via CLI and a minimalist web UI.
- **Who it‚Äôs for:** Learners and developers who want a compact reference for adding AI features‚Äîcode review automation and conversational assistance‚Äîinto a Bun + TypeScript project.
- **Why it matters:** Demonstrates a practical, AI-enhanced dev workflow; shows how to structure prompts, stream responses, and design small, testable modules. It‚Äôs easy to extend for coursework or real projects.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Languages:** TypeScript
- **Runtime:** Bun
- **AI SDKs:** `ai`, `@ai-sdk/google`
- **Utilities:** `simple-git` for diff summaries, `zod` for input validation (tools)
- **Build/Config:** `tsconfig.json`
- **UI:** Static HTML/CSS served by `Bun.serve()`

## üß† AI Integration Strategy

- **Code generation:**
  - Use IDE chat to scaffold new modules (e.g., `chatbot.ts`, `server.ts`).
  - Follow `.cursorrules` to enforce small, streaming-first functions and DRY prompts.
  - Rely on `PLAN.md` for folder structure and function signatures during scaffolding.

- **Testing:**
  - Use AI to draft smoke tests and request-targeted prompts like: ‚ÄúWrite a smoke test for `server.ts` POST /chat, validating JSON input and streaming output handling.‚Äù
  - For unit tests, prompt AI to generate test tables for edge cases (empty input, non-JSON, large messages).

- **Documentation:**
  - Generate docstrings and inline comments via AI prompts referencing `#file:server.ts` or `@code chatbot.ts` to maintain context.
  - Keep README up to date by prompting AI with the latest file tree and plan.

- **Context-aware techniques:**
  - Feed AI the file tree, diffs (`tools.ts` + `simple-git`), and specific files using in-editor context commands (e.g., `@code`, `#file`, `@thread`).
  - For reviews, run the code review agent with a directory-focused prompt to critique changes.

Push this README.md at the repo root (you can verify on GitHub) to satisfy the course deliverable.

## Features

- **Code Review Agent**: Analyzes git diffs with detailed feedback (`index.ts`)
- **CLI Chatbot**: Interactive terminal-based AI assistant (`chatbot.ts`)
- **Web UI**: Modern streaming chat interface with dashboard (`server.ts` + `public/index.html`)
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests for core functionality (`tests/`)
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Robust logging and input validation
- **Complete Documentation**: Usage guides, API docs, and development reflection
- **Environment Configuration**: Flexible setup with `.env` support
- Project guidance via `.cursorrules` and the full development plan in `PLAN.md`.

## Requirements

- Bun (latest): https://bun.sh/
- Node.js (optional, not required to run, but useful for tooling)
- A Google Generative AI API key

## Setup

1) Install dependencies (Bun will use `package.json`):

```bash
bun install
```

2) Set your Google key (PowerShell example on Windows):

```powershell
$env:GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

Alternatively, create a `.env` file in the project root and add:

```env
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

Ensure your environment loads `.env` when running (Bun supports this if configured in your shell; otherwise set the variable in your session).

## Scripts

Defined in `package.json`:

- `bun run chat "message"` ‚Äì Run the CLI chatbot once with a prompt.
- `bun run dev` ‚Äì Start the minimal web server at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

### 1) Code Review Agent (existing)

The code review agent streams review text for a target directory. See `index.ts` and adjust the prompt:

```ts
await codeReviewAgent(
  "Review the code changes in '../my-agent' directory, make your reviews and suggestions file by file",
);
```

Run with Bun:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

### 2) Chatbot ‚Äì CLI

```bash
bun run chat "Hello from CLI"
```

The response will stream to `stdout`.

### 3) Chatbot ‚Äì Web UI

```bash
bun run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

Type a message and you‚Äôll see the response stream in the UI.

#### Dashboard Sidebar
- The web UI includes a left sidebar ‚ÄúDashboard‚Äù with quick actions:
  - New Chat
  - Recent Chats
  - Settings
  - About
- You can extend these to real functionality (persist conversations, store settings) as follow-ups.

## Development Workflow

This repo includes an AI-enhanced workflow plan in `PLAN.md`. Highlights:

- Choose a focused feature (here: add a chatbot alongside the code review agent).
- Plan and document folder structure, prompts, and function signatures.
- Implement with context anchors (e.g., `@code`, `#file`, `@thread`).
- Refactor for readability/maintainability; run `git diff` before/after changes.
- Optionally simulate a code review using the code review agent.

See `.cursorrules` for high-level guidance the AI should follow in this repo (streaming-first, single-responsibility files, security with keys, conventional commits, and DRY prompts/config).

## Security & Performance

- Never expose API keys in client-side code. The web UI posts to the server, which calls the model.
- Inputs to `/chat` are validated; non-JSON or empty messages receive a 400 error.
- Streaming is used for responsiveness.
- If needed, cap tokens in model configs for cost and latency management.

## Troubleshooting

- If you see no output:
  - Ensure `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` is set in your environment.
  - Verify your network connectivity and model availability.
  - Check your console for any runtime errors in `server.ts` or `chatbot.ts`.

- If TypeScript errors occur:
  - Make sure you‚Äôre running with Bun‚Äôs TypeScript support.
  - Inspect `prompts.ts` and `server.ts` for any recent edits.
